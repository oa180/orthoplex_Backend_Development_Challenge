# User Management API with Node.js and SQL

This is a user management API built using Node.js and an SQL database (PostgreSQL). The API allows you to perform user-related operations, including user creation, retrieval, update, and deletion, while focusing on security and best practices.

## Requirements

1. **Node.js and PostgreSQL Database**

   - Implement the necessary configuration to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Set up a schema or table structure to store user data.

2. **Validation and Error Handling**

   - Validate user input to ensure required fields are provided and have appropriate formats.
   - Handle errors that may occur during database operations and provide meaningful error messages in the API responses.

3. **SQL Queries**

   - Create SQL queries to insert new users, retrieve user details, update user details, and delete users.
   - Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

4. **RESTful API Endpoints with Express.js**

   - Create API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting users.
   - Use appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE) and URL patterns for each endpoint.

5. **Authentication with JWT**

   - Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - Protect the API endpoints, allowing only authenticated requests to access the user management functionality.


6. **Pagination for User Listing**

   - Modify the API endpoint for retrieving user details to support pagination.
   - Allow clients to specify the page number and the number of users per page.

7. **Security Enhancements**

   - Implement input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
   - Hash user passwords before storing them in the database using hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2.
   - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the API endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- An SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and the necessary connection details.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-api.git
   cd user-management-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your SQL database connection in a `.env` file.

4. Start the API server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

Your API should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` (or another specified port).

## API Endpoints

The API offers the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/users` - Create a new user.
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users
- `GET /api/users/:userId/profile` - Get user details by ID.
- `PATCH /api/users/:userId/update` - Update user details by ID.
- `DELETE /api/users/:userId/delete` - Delete a user by ID.

### Authentication

To protect the API endpoints, include a JWT token in the request headers using the `Authorization` header. Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
```
